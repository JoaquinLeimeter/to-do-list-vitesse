In https://v3.vuejs.org/guide/introduction.html#composing-with-components on the composing with components setion:
    -on line 13 it says
        '// Mount Vue application
        app.mount(...)'

        -is it mounting toDoItem? and how is it refering to it on the html? shouldn't it use an id?
        -Oh now I see it in the next example haha
        -but where is todo-item coming from? maybe from components { todoItem } ??
